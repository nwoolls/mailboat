# Developing Mailboat

Building, running and checking the app. For how it fits together, see
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md); for what is planned, [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Requirements

- macOS with Xcode command line tools (its Swift compiler builds the
  Apple Intelligence helper; Apple Intelligence itself needs macOS 26+)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (stable)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh): `brew install oven-sh/bun/bun`
- Optional but recommended: an Apple Development certificate (free Apple ID,
  Xcode → Settings → Accounts → Manage Certificates → + Apple Development),
  so macOS doesn't ask for keychain access after every rebuild.

## Run

```sh
bun install
bun tauri dev
```

The first sync of an account takes a while (Gmail's per-user quota limits
the pace); the inbox fills in first. Later syncs only fetch changes.

### Demo mode

```sh
bun run demo
```

Starts the app full of made-up mail, with no Google connection: two
accounts (personal and work), 24 conversations with attachments,
labels (one of them empty), a meeting invitation, a draft, spam, trash, list
summaries, Gmail rules, and a vacation reply set to start in a few days.
None of your own mail can show. Archiving, labels, rules and the rest all
work. Sending is faked: the message lands in Sent and the person answers
about 8 seconds later. A sign-in code arrives 45 seconds after the window opens.

The made-up mail lives in `demo/mail.json` (reserved `.example` addresses
only). Like the clean start below, the demo keeps to its own folder
(`com.nwoolls.mailboat.demo`) and starts over at every launch, dated
relative to now. It takes the flag `--demo` in the same ways.

The pictures in the README and in [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) are taken from
the demo, with scripts you can run again:
[scripts/screenshots/README.md](../scripts/screenshots/README.md).

### A first launch, again and again (clean start)

```sh
bun run clean-start
```

Starts the app as if it had never run: no accounts, no settings, no OAuth
client file. It keeps to a folder of its own
(`~/Library/Application Support/com.nwoolls.mailboat.clean-start`), its own
keychain name (`com.nwoolls.mailboat.clean-start`) and web storage that's
gone when it quits, and all of it is emptied at the next clean start.
Your own accounts, mail and settings aren't touched, and the AI apps
connection (MCP) stays with the normal copy.

`bun run clean-start` starts its own dev server, so stop `bun tauri dev`
first, or start the built dev copy next to it:
`target/debug/Mailboat.app/Contents/MacOS/mailboat --clean-start`. An installed
copy takes the same flag: `open -n -a Mailboat --args --clean-start` on the
Mac, `mailboat.exe --clean-start` on Windows.

## Windows (built on the Mac)

Mailboat for Windows is built on the Mac and tried in a Windows VM. One-time
setup:

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-pc-windows-msvc x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
brew install llvm lld nsis
cargo install cargo-xwin --locked
```

Then:

```sh
scripts/windows.sh check   # does it compile for Windows, with no lint warnings
scripts/windows.sh build   # makes the installer (.exe)
```

The installer lands in `target/aarch64-pc-windows-msvc/release/bundle/nsis/`.
Copy it into the VM and run it. It's for Windows on ARM (a VM on an Apple
silicon Mac); for an Intel/AMD PC, set
`WINDOWS_TARGET=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` first. The Google client file
goes in `%APPDATA%\com.nwoolls.mailboat\google-oauth-client.json`.

The installer registers Mailboat as an email app. To have email links open
it, choose Mailboat for `MAILTO` in Settings → Apps → Default apps (Mailboat's
Settings → General → Email links opens that page).

## Check

```sh
bun run check:quick   # while working: only what changed, fast tests only
bun run check         # everything (format, lint, types, Vitest, clippy, cargo test, Playwright); before committing
```

The browser tests (`tests/browser`, Playwright) need WebKit and Chromium once:

```sh
bunx playwright install webkit chromium
```

## Files on your Mac

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Mail cache (SQLite) | `~/Library/Application Support/com.nwoolls.mailboat/mail.sqlite3` |
| OAuth client file | `~/Library/Application Support/com.nwoolls.mailboat/google-oauth-client.json` |
| Sign-in tokens | macOS Keychain, service `com.nwoolls.mailboat` |
| Sync log | `~/Library/Logs/com.nwoolls.mailboat/sync.log` |
| AI summaries | In the mail cache (`ai_summaries`: the summary text, so it isn't generated twice) |
| AI usage | In the mail cache (`ai_usage`: sizes only, never prompts or answers) |
| AI apps' socket | `~/Library/Application Support/com.nwoolls.mailboat/mcp.sock` (while Mailboat runs) |
| AI apps' requests | In the mail cache (`mcp_log`: what was asked, never content; 30 days) |
